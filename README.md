# LLVM_PASS

## this is a collection of some projects using llvm pass to instrument

**in the folder srciror there is a tool for mutating and analysing coverage**

**in the folder llvm_instru_master there is a project demo**

if use
clang++ -c basic_block_pass.cpp `llvm-config --cxxflags`
clang++ -shared -o pass.so basic_block_pass.o `llvm-config --ldflags`
to compile my pass
then it's necessary to add "-undefined suppress -flat_namespace"

notice that in llvm 11. the method getorinsertfunction is no longer a constant class but a fuctioncallee one. Use getFunction after it has been inserted
